# 遇到的问题

## eslint报错

eject之后，js文件都会有一个eslint的报错
```js
Parsing error: [BABEL] E:\desk\ReactAndVue\Boby\src\App.js: Using `babel-preset-react-app` requires that you specify `NODE_ENV` or `BABEL_ENV` environment variables. Valid values are "development", "test", and "production". Instead, received: undefined. (
```

在package.json的eslintConfig下添加
```js
"parserOptions": {
      "babelOptions": {
        "presets": [
          ["babel-preset-react-app", false],
          ["babel-preset-react-app/prod"]
        ]
      }
    }
```

## webpack路径别名

为了让项目的路径看起来更加清晰简洁，我们在webpack.config.js文件中alias下增加这样一条配置：
```js
'@': path.join(__dirname, '..', 'src'),
```
这样我们可以通过绝对路径来引用文件，而不是数不清的../../../...
```js
import Home from '@/pages/home';
```
当然只在webpack配置是没有语法提示的，我们还需要在根目录创建```jsconfig.json```文件
```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```
详细配置见vscode文档 https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
